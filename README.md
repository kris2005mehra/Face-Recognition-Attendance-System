# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This Is My Face Recognition Attendance System Project For Zidio Development.


# Project Overview:-

Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System, developed during my internship at Zidio Development. This project leverages cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies to automate attendance tracking in educational and professional settings.

# Features:-

Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect faces in real-time, ensuring accurate attendance capture.

Attendance Logging: Automatically records attendance data, making it easy to track and manage participant presence.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, allowing users to quickly navigate and manage attendance records.

Data Security: Implements secure data storage practices to protect sensitive information.

# Technologies Used:-

Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow/Keras

# Usage:-
Launch the application in your browser.

Enroll users by capturing their facial images.

Start the attendance session to automatically record participants as they arrive.

# Conclusion:-

This project not only enhances my understanding of face recognition technology but also showcases my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. I hope this system proves to be a valuable tool for managing attendance efficiently.
